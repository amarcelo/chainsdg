Project for hackathon Polygon/Impact+
Chain SDG Project is an ambitious initiative aimed at promoting and incentivizing the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Polygon is a high-performance blockchain that offers a scalable and low-cost solution for executing smart contracts and creating decentralized applications. Choosing this blockchain for the Chain SDG project allows transactions to be performed quickly and securely, as well as offering a low-cost solution for users.

With the Chain SDG platform, companies, governments, and non-profit organizations can certify compliance with the UN's SDGs by issuing audited NFTs on the Polygon blockchain. These tokens can be traded on specific markets, generating financial incentives for organizations that achieve goals in a sustainable manner.

Moreover, the Chain SDG project also offers a solution to the lack of transparency and reliability in information related to the compliance with SDGs. Through blockchain technology and audits conducted on Polygon, information is recorded transparently and immutably, ensuring its integrity and authenticity.



The Chain SDG project works in the following way:

1. Creation of NFTs for each of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that represent the goal and contain information about its implementation.

2. Collection of evidence related to the implementation of each SDG by organizations, governments, and companies.

3. Verification of the evidence collected through audits conducted on the Polygon blockchain, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the information.

4. Issuance of audited NFTs to organizations that have achieved the SDGs sustainably, which can be traded on specific markets.

5. Promotion of the implementation of the SDGs by offering financial incentives for organizations that achieve the goals sustainably, and by creating a transparent and reliable system for tracking progress towards the SDGs.

In summary, the Chain SDG project creates a certification platform that uses blockchain technology and NFTs to promote and incentivize the implementation of the UN's SDGs, while also creating a transparent and reliable system for tracking progress towards these goals.


Impact Measurement

For each audit conducted by our organization, the company will receive a set of points based on the questions formulated by the UN regarding each SDG. Based on this, a non-fungible token (NFT) will be issued, which will initially be static, but the idea is to make it dynamic in the future.

After receiving the NFT, the company will issue an equivalent number of tokens that will function as a currency. These tokens will be provided to beneficiaries for the completion of activities such as:

1. Specialization courses taught by partner organizations;

2. Medical/dental services;

3. Basic food baskets.

In summary, the impact measurement process involves conducting audits on each SDG, issuing an NFT to the company based on the results, and providing tokens to beneficiaries for completing activities that contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. This incentivizes companies to make sustainable changes and promotes progress towards the UN's SDGs.

When the company uses the tokens to pay partner organizations, the equivalent in fiat currency will be paid out. These tokens will then be burned after their use.

In addition, our group has developed an auditing tool that enables the tracking of all operations made with specific tokens from a company on the blockchain, creating transparency in the process.

We will start by certifying four SDGs, but our goal is to cover all 17 of them in the future.
